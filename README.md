# PDF Slideshow

This repository implements the MVP to play PDF pages in loop with custom interval. If you find this useful you can star the project.

## Keyboard shortcuts
- `ArrowLeft` shows previous page
- `ArrowRight` shows next page
- `Space` starts/stops slideshow
- On chromium based browsers `F11` shows webpage in full screen mode

> Note: It uses [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) to render pages.
